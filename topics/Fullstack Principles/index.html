        Which technologies are full stack?
    </div>
    <div class="fragment answer">
        Being Full Stack does <u>NOT</u> mean knowing a set of technologies. It means knowing the <span class="color-azure">layers</span> and the <span class="color-azure">principles</span>        by which they operate and connect.

    </div>
    <div class="fragment answer">
        There are, basically, four layers:
        <span>Front-end</span>,
        <span>Back-end</span>,

    <h3>Frontend</h3>
    <div>
        Can be a static page in a browser, an ajax -, or a mobile app. Your code runs on the user's device with restricted previliages. In all cases, the frontend is the user faceing side of the system. The input/output mechanism of the web application.

    <h3>Backend</h3>
    <div>
        Can be a home pc, data center rack or a virtual container in the cloud. On the backend your code is king. It is where the complex, secret, and long-running tasks should run. The backend is the "heart" of the web application.

    <h3>Network</h3>
    <div>
        The network connects the front-end, the back-end and the WORLD. The internet is based on the TCP/IP protocol. The web is based on the HTTP protocol. Other popular protocols include: HTTPS, WebSockets, BitTorrent. There are multiple modes of communication:
        request/response, streaming; And multiple degrees of durability, reliability, security, latency, etc

    <h3>DevOps</h3>
    <div>
        DevOps is the setting up your development and production environment, using source control and package managment, and automating your process. It is a sometimes overlooked, but vital layer of any big web application project.
