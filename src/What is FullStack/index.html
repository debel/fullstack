  </div>
  <div class="fragment answer">
    It is a qualifier for people who work on mostly all aspects of a system.<br/>
    E.g. He is a full stack web developer. She is a full stack electronics engineer.

  <div class="question">
    Are there different types of full stack?
  </div>
  <div class="fragment answer">
    Yes, as many as types of systems.<br/>
    Electronics Systems would require understanding controllers, sensors, etc<br/>
    Cryptographic systems require mathematics and threat modeling</br/>
    Operating systems - computer architectures (cpu, memory, etc)<br/>
    Games - 3d, game theory, networking<br/>
    There are also many overlapping topics.<br/>
    This course focuses on Full Stack Web Development.

  <div class="question">
    Which technologies are full stack?
  </div>
  <div class="fragment answer">
    There are many technology stacks that provide utilities on almost all levels. However,<br/>
    Being Full Stack does NOT mean knowing a set of technologies. It means knowing the layers and the principles by which they operate and connect.

    <div class="question">
      What are the web layers and principles?
    </div>
    <div class="fragment answer">
      There are, basically, three layers:
      <span style="font-size: 1.2em">Front-end</span>, <span style="font-size: 1.2em">Back-end</span> and the <span style="font-size: 1.2em">Network</span>.
      However each layer has its own ecosystem of tools and best practices.
      In {{Web Architectures}} we will explore typical patterns found in popular web applications.
      We will also look into the {{RESTful principles}} and the {{SOLID principles}}.

  <section class="frontend">
    <h3>Frontend</h3>
    <div>
      Can be a static page in a browser, an ajax -, or a mobile app. Your code runs on the user's device with restricted previliages. In all cases, the frontend is the user faceing side of the system. The input/output mechanism of the web application.
    </div>
  </section>
  <section class="backend">
    <h3>Backend</h3>
    <div>
      Can be a home pc, data center rack or a virtual container in the cloud. On the backend your code is king. It is where the complex, secret, and long-running tasks should run. The backend is the motherboard of the web application (with processing, memory
      and storage attached).

  <section class="network">
    <h3>Network</h3>
    <div>
      The network connects the front-end, the back-end and the WORLD. The internet is based on the TCP/IP protocol. The web is based on the HTTP protocol. Other popular protocols include: HTTPS, WebRTC, WebSockets, BitTorrent, etc OSI stack Multiple modes of
      communication: request/response, streaming, Multiple degrees of durability, reliability, security, latency and through-put
