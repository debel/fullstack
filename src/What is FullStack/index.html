  <div class="question">
    Are there different types of full stack?
  </div>
  <div class="fragment answer">
    Yes, as many as types of systems.<br/>
    <span class="color-carrot">Electronics Systems</span> would require understanding chips, sensors<br/>
    <span class="color-carrot">Cryptographic systems</span> require mathematics and threat modeling</br/>
    <span class="color-carrot">Operating systems</span> - computer architectures (cpu, memory, etc)<br/>
    <span class="color-carrot">Games</span> - 3d, game theory, networking<br/>
    There are also many overlapping topics.<br/>

  <div class="question">
    Which technologies are full stack?
  </div>
  <div class="fragment answer">
    There are many technology stacks that provide utilities on almost all levels.
    However being Full Stack does <u>NOT</u> mean knowing a set of technologies.
    It means knowing the <span class="color-carrot">layers</span>
    and the <span class="color-carrot">principles</span> by which they operate and connect.

    <div class="question">
      What are the web layers and principles?
    </div>
    <div class="fragment answer">
      There are, basically, three layers:
      <span style="font-size: 1.2em">Front-end</span>, <span style="font-size: 1.2em">Back-end</span> and the <span style="font-size: 1.2em">Network</span>.
      However each layer has its own ecosystem of tools and best practices.
      In {{Web Architectures}} we will explore typical patterns found in popular web applications.
      We will also look into the {{RESTful principles}} and the {{SOLID principles}}.

    <div>
      Can be a static page in a browser, an ajax -, or a mobile app. Your code runs on the user's device with restricted previliages. In all cases, the frontend is the user faceing side of the system. The input/output mechanism of the web application.

    <div>
      Can be a home pc, data center rack or a virtual container in the cloud. On the backend your code is king. It is where the complex, secret, and long-running tasks should run. The backend is the motherboard of the web application (with processing, memory
      and storage attached).
