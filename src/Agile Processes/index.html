  <h4>Stand up</h4>
  Most teams prefer to have a daily stand up meeting every morning
  when everyone has gathers or is available online. The purpose of the stand up
  is to privide each team member with an opportunity to share important information with the team.
  It is however a very popular and easy mistake to turn the stand up into a status report meeting. It is NOT.
  Team members should only report blockers, schedule individual or group meetings, or reveal new information to the team.

  <h4>Planning and other meetings</h4>
  Teams usually hold a planning meeting every two weeks in order to realign the team and repreoritize the work.
  All meetings should be focused and produce actionable items for each participant.
  Peer/Group coding in a mix of senior and junior developers is usually encouraged.
